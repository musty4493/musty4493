Hello, Iâ€™m Mustafa. I am currently learning Python and have just entered the world of software development. I have completed my high school and university education, which were more focused on hardware. I lack experience in software, but I am eager to improve myself by participating in projects. I would be very grateful if you could support me in this regard.

Let me know if you need any other translations or further assistance! ðŸ˜Š
